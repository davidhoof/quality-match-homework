Run the code directly with Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidhoof/quality-match-homework/blob/master/QualityMatchHomework.ipynb).
The used data is confidential and has to be added manually.

If you don't want to use Colab and run it locally, you just need to clone this repository:
